# PublicPernStack First Attempt
 
Hi, this is some of the backend code from my old first foray into a Fullstack PERN APP technically I used PEEN with EJS instead of REACT. I now know REACT and will be posting a new repository with all of the code when I finish. The frontend code was removed here and some more logic because it I wrote it for someone else and it is private.
